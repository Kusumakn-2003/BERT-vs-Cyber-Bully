# BERT-vs-Cyber-Bully
Project Overview
Cyberbullying has now become the new trend of today's digital world, most common amongst younger users. Using social media, gaming applications, and messaging tools has ensured that a person engages with somebody online all through. With such applications available for all to communicate, they also paved their way to carry on malpractices such as harassing, ridiculing, and exclusion. The anonymous nature of the internet allows cyberbullies to target victims without fear of immediate consequences. As a result, the emotional and psychological toll on victims can be severe, leading to long-term effects such as anxiety, depression, and in extreme cases, self-harm. The urgency of the issue notwithstanding, previous solutions have not been effective enough to address both the obvious and subtle forms of cyberbullying across diverse platforms.

Project Introduction
In recent years, there has been an alarming increase in cyberbullying incidents. Bullying behaviors have become hotspots in social media platforms, where younger users are especially active.While some forms of cyberbullying are overt and easy to identify, such as name-calling and threats, many others are subtle and harder to detect, such as exclusionary tactics, indirect insults, and manipulative behavior. This calls for more complex systems that can identify those behaviors and intervene in actual time. The increasing rate of cyberbullying has raised awareness and concern across the globe of the need to create safer virtual environments for all users of digital environments.
